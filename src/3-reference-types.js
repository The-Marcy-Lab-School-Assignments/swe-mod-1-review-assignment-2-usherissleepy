/* 
Part A: What will team1.wins and team1.losses be after this code runs? Write your prediction as a comment below:

- Prediction: The wins will be 50 and the losses will be 15

Part B: Fix the code so that team2 is a TRUE COPY of team1. After making your fix, changing team2 should NOT affect team1.
Part C: Verify your fix by logging both team1.wins (should still be 45) and team2.wins (should be 50)
